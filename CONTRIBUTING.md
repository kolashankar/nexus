- Git

### Setup Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/karma-nexus.git
   cd karma-nexus
   ```

2. **Add upstream remote**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/karma-nexus.git
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/` - New features
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/` - Urgent fixes for production
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `test/` - Adding or updating tests

**Examples:**
- `feature/add-guild-wars`
- `bugfix/fix-karma-calculation`
- `docs/update-api-documentation`

### Commit Message Convention

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): subject

body (optional)

footer (optional)
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(combat): add turn-based combat system

fix(karma): correct karma calculation for edge cases

docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Development Process

1. **Create a new branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow coding standards (see below)
   - Add tests for new features
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Backend tests
   cd backend
   pytest
   
   # Frontend tests
   cd frontend
   yarn test
   yarn test:e2e
   ```

4. **Lint your code**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   ruff check .
   
   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   yarn lint
   ```

5. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(scope): your commit message"
   ```

6. **Keep your fork up to date**
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

7. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
- Use type hints for function arguments and return values
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use docstrings for classes and functions
- Use `ruff` for linting

**Example:**
```python
def calculate_karma(action: str, target: Player) -> int:
    """Calculate karma change based on action and target.
    
    Args:
        action: Type of action performed
        target: Target player object
        
    Returns:
        Karma change amount
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### TypeScript (Frontend)

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Use functional components and React Hooks
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use ESLint for linting

**Example:**
```typescript
interface PlayerProps {
  username: string;
  karma: number;
}

export const PlayerCard: React.FC<PlayerProps> = ({ username, karma }) => {
  // Implementation
  return (
    <div className="player-card">
      <h3>{username}</h3>
      <p>Karma: {karma}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### General Guidelines

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Write simple, understandable code
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't add functionality until needed
- **Comments**: Write self-documenting code; use comments to explain "why", not "what"
- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications, especially for frequently called code

## Testing

### Testing Requirements

- **All new features** must include tests
- **Bug fixes** should include a test that would have caught the bug
- Maintain **minimum 60% code coverage**
- Tests should be **fast** and **isolated**

### Backend Testing

**Unit Tests:**
```python
import pytest
from services.karma import calculate_karma

def test_karma_calculation():
    result = calculate_karma("help", mock_player)
    assert result > 0
```

**Integration Tests:**
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_player_action_flow(client, auth_headers):
    response = await client.post(
        "/api/actions/help",
        json={"target_id": "player_123"},
        headers=auth_headers
    )
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

### Frontend Testing

**Component Tests:**
```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { PlayerCard } from './PlayerCard';

test('renders player card', () => {
  render(<PlayerCard username="Test" karma={100} />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Test')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

**E2E Tests:**
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('user can login', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/login');
  await page.fill('input[name="username"]', 'testuser');
  await page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'password');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');
});
```
