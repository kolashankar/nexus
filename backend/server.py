# Add new routes to main server
# This is a marker file showing where to add routes
# The routes should be added to the existing server.py

# Add to imports:
# from api.v1.crafting import router as crafting_router
# from api.v1.real_estate import router as real_estate_router
# from api.v1.investments import router as investments_router

# Add to app.include_router calls:
# app.include_router(crafting_router, prefix="/api/v1")
# app.include_router(real_estate_router, prefix="/api/v1")
# app.include_router(investments_router, prefix="/api/v1")
